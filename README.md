# PNG Parser in pure python

### [Open in Google Colab](https://githubtocolab.com/previoip/jupyter-png-parser)

## First of all: Be Advised

Running jupyter notebook from unknown sources may be harmful to your system. Before running any script on your local machine, make sure to review and check whether any notebook given does not have malicious script inside. For example a sys call for removing system files, or an external request to a shady endpoint. tldr; never trust a random script you find in the internet.

Some part of the notebook however, requires active internet connection and will require around few megabytes of data and local storage, which will download and extract test suite into root directory of the notebook file. There are options to disable this feature.

Use it at your own risk.
